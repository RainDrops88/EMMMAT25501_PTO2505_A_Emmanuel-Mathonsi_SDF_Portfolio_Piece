# ðŸ’¼ SDFPP Resume Project

Welcome to my first major **portfolio project** in the Software Development Program is a resume project (SDFPP). In this challenge, using a [Figma design file](https://www.figma.com/design/fM2tutgIH0k1SrNir4MVe3/SDF-Resume-Project-STUDENT-REFERENCE-FILE?node-id=0-1&t=yGSXI1yv4AgjKBvA-1) as reference, Iâ€™ll create my very own online resume â€” a personal website that shows off my skills, experience, and code style using **HTML and CSS**.

This is not just practice â€” this is something I can proudly include in my portfolio and share with future employers!
